# MESIO-Optimization-Electricity-Systems-Markets
The following repository contains my solutions to the weeky assigments for the Optimization in Energy Systems and Markets course @ MESIO Fall 2025. 
The implementation of the optimization models is typically done in the Algebraic Modeling Languages AMPL and Pyomo.

## Installation
In order to run AMPL-based modes you need a valid license and `ampl` available in your PATH. To run the Pyomo implementations, simply build a Python virtual enviroment with the available `pyproject.toml`.
